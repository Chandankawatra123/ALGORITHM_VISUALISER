# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 


This is made to be the second version of my previous pathfinding project made with C++ igraphics. But then added some more visualizations too.  

So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Sorting Algorithms
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree


## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A star
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- 
-Graham Scan for Convex Hull

- Binary Search
- Recursion
  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
